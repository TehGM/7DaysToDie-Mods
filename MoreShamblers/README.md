# 7DTD Mod: More Shamblers
Increases spawn rates of zombies on map, to make the world feel more alive (ironic, I know). Zombies will also often spawn in pairs, making them a little bit more dangerous.

Spawn rates of hordes, zombies in buildings and animals are not changed. Only randomly roaming zombies spawn more.
