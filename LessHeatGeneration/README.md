# 7DTD Mod: Less Heat Generation
I found [heatmap mechanic](https://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/Heatmap) to be... a band-aid on missing mechanics wound. I don't like it, however at current state of the game, it's needed to impose any challenge.

This mod reduces heat generation of blocks, but doesn't disable it completely. This way it there's still danger in doing a lot in the base, but reduces the annoyance of heatmap mechanic.

### Value changes
Note: original values are per 7 Days to Die alpha 19.3.
- Campfire: 5 -> 2.5

#### Customizing
