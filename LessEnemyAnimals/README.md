# 7DTD Mod: Less Enemy Animals
Reduces spawn rates of enemy animals on map. They still spawn, as they're useful as an challenge, but I found them annoying, so decided to make such occurences less common.

Spawn rates of zombies, hordes, neutral animals and enemy animals in buildings are not changed.

### Value changes
Note: original values are per 7 Days to Die alpha 19.3.
- Pine Forest:  
  Enemy animal respawn delay: 1.1 -> 1.4  
  Enemy animal spawn count: *unchanged*
- Burnt Forest:  
  Enemy animal respawn delay: 1.1 -> 1.4  
  Enemy animal spawn count: *unchanged*
- Desert:  
  Enemy animal respawn delay: 3.5 -> 4  
  Enemy animal spawn count: *unchanged*
- Wasteland:  
  Enemy animal respawn delay: 0.3 -> 1.3  
  Enemy animal spawn count: *unchanged*
- Snow:  
  Enemy animal respawn delay: 3.1 -> 3.5  
  Enemy animal spawn count: *unchanged*

#### Customizing
If you want to further change values, simply change values in [Config/spawning.xml](Config/spawning.xml) file after you've installed the mod.
