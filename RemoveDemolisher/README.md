# 7DTD Mod: RemoveDemolisher
[Demolisher Zombie](https://7daystodie.gamepedia.com/Demolisher) is a zombie that spawns in blood moon hordes. I found the zombie act heavily against my play-style, as it requires very heavily fortified base - while I want naturalish-looking homes for bases. For that reason, I decided to remove it from my playthroughs.
